11181,"Go to the walk-in clinic, not er."
11183,Get. Over. Your. Self. lol!
11184,Get used 2 it. Welcome 2 womanhood.
11185,Notthingg 2 b scared of.

11188,Did you get the drawers??
11189,Take ibuprofen now.
11190,Ydid she get a song to gerself?
11191,Ouch!
11195,Yesssss!! This is what this song should be!
11197,Is this joelle?
11198,Could do without all the dancing tho.
11199,Now THIS girl is performing!
11201,Is that what it is? Cuz i'm sittin' here thinkin her tone is like cher.
11202,Boring. Bored. Waiting for david. I know he's gonna kill.
11203,Everybody on the feed is talkin about how the band is str8 killin! And apparently some girl named kayla is supposed to be good.
11204,But i don't think the bgvs look horrible. Look how much space they have to work with.
11205,Just no excitement in these voices.
11206,Smh.
11207,"Ok, when you get home ima play the real version of this song. She kinda sux."
11208,So glad i'm not there. he is just annoying. Usher?? Really?
11209,The bread? It's GOOD!!
11213,I'll cry.
11215,Of course. I guess god's just got me on hold right now.
11216,You've already got a flaky parent. It'snot supposed to be the child's job to support the parent...not until they're The Ride age anyway. I'm supposed to be there to support you. And now i've hurt you. unintentional. But hurt nonetheless.
11221,Are you busy tonight?
11223,"It's not that you make me cry. It's just that when all our stuff happens on top of everything else, it pushes me over the edge. You don't underdtand how often i cry over my sorry, sorry life."
11225,Idk. I'm sitting here in a stop and shop parking lot right now bawling my eyes out because i feel like i'm a failure in everything. Nobody wants me and now i feel like i'm failing you.
11226,I don't want you to leave. But i'm barely doing what i can to stay sane. fighting with you constantly isn't helping.
11227,"Idk. You keep saying that you're not, but since he moved, we keep butting heads over freedom vs. responsibility. And i'm tired. I have so much other to deal with that i'm barely keeping myself together once this gets added to it."
11230,"You are always putting your business out there. You put pictures of your on facebook. You are one of the most open people i've ever met. Why would i think a picture of your room would hurt you, make you feel violated."
11231,"The last thing i ever wanted to do was hurt you. And i didn't think it would have. You'd laugh, be embarassed, delete the tag and keep going. But as far as i knew, it wasn't even up. The fact that you even felt like i would do it to hurt you shows you really don't know me at all. It was messy wednesday, but it wasn't bad. The problem i have with it is you HAVE the time to clean it, but you choose not to. You skype, you take pictures, you sleep, you want to go out. I don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else. You used to be good about at least making the bed."
11232,Please don't text me anymore. I have nothing else to say.
11234,I tagged MY friends that you seemed to count as YOUR friends.
11235,"Wow. I never realized that you were so embarassed by your accomodations. I thought you liked it, since i was doing the best i could and you always seemed so happy about ""the cave"". I'm sorry I didn't and don't have more to give. I'm sorry i offered. I'm sorry your room was so embarassing."
11236,"I NEVERsaid dirty. That is YOUR word, not mine."
11238,"no, i *didn't* mean to post it. I wrote it, and like so many other times i've ritten stuff to you, i let it sit there. it WAS what i was feeling at the time. I was angry. Before i left, i hit send, then stop. It wasn't there. I checked on my phone when i got to my car. It wasn't there. You said you didn't sleep, you were bored. So why wouldn't THAT be the time to clean, fold laundry, etc.? At least make the bed?"
11240,Yes. that will be fine. Love you. Be safe.
11243,what is your account number?
11246,<#> and <#> @ braintree
11247,"!!! ""Nana wants me to stay in the city, so I guess I'll just see u in the morning. Me n jaleah will be at home at like 9."""
11252,Is that what time you want me to come?
11253,Alright. I'm out--have a good night!
11254,And Chuck.
11257,i thought we were doing a king of the hill thing there.
11260,I'm always looking for an excuse to be in the city.
11261,That means from february to april i'll be getting a place to stay down there so i don't have to hustle back and forth during audition season as i have since my sister moved away from harlem.
11263,"Especially since i talk about boston all up in my personal statement, lol! I woulda changed that if i had realized it said nyc! It says boston now."
11264,"wow. You're right! I didn't mean to do that. I guess once i gave up on boston men and changed my search location to nyc, something changed. Cuz on my signin page it still says boston."
11265,No sir. That's why i had an 8-hr trip on the bus last week. Have another audition next wednesday but i think i might drive this time.
11266,Yes. I come to nyc for audiitions and am trying to relocate.
11267,"I'm used to it. I just hope my agents don't drop me since i've only booked a few things this year. This whole me in boston, them in nyc was an experiment."
11268,Sorry. You never hear unless you book it. One was kinda a joke--thet were really looking for skinny white girls. The other was one line--you can only do so much on camera with that. Something like that they're casting on the look.
11272,I'm fine. And u?
11274,have a good night!
11275,You up? Taking calls?
11276,"Ditto. And you won't have to worry about me saying ANYTHING to you anymore. Like i said last night, you do whatever you want and i'll do the same. Peace."
11277,"For you information, IKEA is spelled with all caps. That is not yelling. when you thought i had left you, you were sitting on the bed among the mess when i came in. i said we were going after you got home from class. please don't try and me. It makes me want to listen to you less."
11278,Bull. Your plan was to go floating off to IKEA with me without a care in the world. So i have to live with your mess another day.
11279,"The fact that you're cleaning shows you know why i'm upset. Your priority is constantly ""what i want to do,"" not ""what i need to do."""
11280,"And that is the problem. You walk around in ""julianaland"" oblivious to what is going on around you. I say the same things constantly and they go in one ear and out the other while you go off doing whatever you want to do. It's not that you don't know why I'm upset--it's that you don't listen when i tell you WHAT is going to upset me. Then you want to be surprised when I'm mad."
11282,Any chance you might have had with me evaporated as soon as you violated my privacy by stealing my phone number from your employer's paperwork. Not cool at all. Please do not contact me again or I will report you to your supervisor.
11285,"Do whatever you want. You know what the rules are. We had a talk earlier this week about what had to start happening, you showing responsibility. Yet, every week it's can i bend the rule this way? What about that way? Do whatever. I'm tired of having thia same argument with you every week. And a <#> movie DOESNT inlude the previews. You're still getting in after 1."
11286,"Whatever, juliana. Do whatever you want."
11287,I accidentally deleted the message. Resend please.
11288,"see, i knew giving you a break a few times woul lead to you always wanting to miss curfew. I was gonna gibe you 'til one, but a MIDNIGHT movie is not gonna get out til after 2. You need to come home. You need to getsleep and, if anything, you need to b studdying ear training."
11289,"I don,t think so. You don't need to be going out that late on a school night. ESPECIALLY when the one class you have is the one you missed last wednesday and probably failed a test in on friday"
11290,"Oh really? perform, write a paper, go to a movie AND be home by midnight, huh?"
11292,Nope. Sorry!
11294,Alrighty then.
11295,"Ok, Mr. Vague, lol."
11296,I actually did for the first time in a while. I went to bed not too long after i spoke with you. Woke up at 7. How was your night?
11297,Hola. How are you?
11301,As if i wasn't having enough trouble sleeping.
11302,"The guy at the car shop who was flirting with me got my phone number from the paperwork and called and texted me. I'm nervous because of course now he may have my address. Should i call his boss and tell him, knowing this may get him fired?"
11303,Can i get your opinion on something first?
11304,"Sorry about earlier. Putting out fires.Are you around to talk after 9? Or do you actually have a life, lol!"
11307,Probably money worries. Things are coming due and i have several outstanding invoices for work i did two and three months ago.
11308,Oh really?? Did you make it on air? What's your talent?
11309,Tired. I haven't slept well the past few nights.
11310,"It,,s a taxt massage....tie-pos argh ok! Lool!"
11311,"Nice. Wait...should you be texting right now? I'm not gonna pay your ticket, ya know!"
11312,What do you do?
11313,"I'm an actor. When i work, i work in the evening and sleep late. Since i'm unemployed at the moment, i ALWAYS sleep late. When you're unemployed, every day is saturday."
11314,Ahhh. Work. I vaguely remember that! What does it feel like? Lol
11315,Why are u up so early?
11319,I was about to do it when i texted. I finished a long time ago and showered and er'ything!
11320,"You aren't coming home between class, right? I need to work out and shower!"
11321,SP <#> CMD=REGISTER;ID=4;IMEI= <#> ;SIM= <#> ;MCC= <#> ;MNC= <#> ;

17772,"Hey, you around?"
17774,Welp apparently he retired
17777,Midnight at the earliest
17778,"Hey, a guy I know is breathing down my neck to get him some bud, anyway you'd be able to get a half track to usf tonight?"
17779,"(I should add that I don't really care and if you can't I can at least get this dude to off but hey, your money if you want it)"
17781,We're on the opposite side from where we dropped you off
17783,Holy living christ what is taking you so long

17791,"That's cool, I'll come by like <#> ish"
17792,Alex knows a guy who sells mids but he's down in south tampa and I don't think I could set it up before like 8
17794,"Awesome, I remember the last time we got somebody high for the first time with diesel :V"
17795,"Aight, I should be there by 8 at the latest, probably closer to 7. Are jay and tyler down or should we just do two trips?"
17797,"I don't have anybody's number, I still haven't thought up a tactful way to ask alex"
17798,What I'm saying is if you haven't explicitly told nora I know someone I'm probably just not gonna bother
17799,Ok I'm gonna head up to usf in like fifteen minutes
17800,"Haha nice, will do"
17801,I'm at mu
17802,(Where are you)
17803,"Hurry up, I've been weed-deficient for like three days"
17805,"""Gimme a few"" was <#> minutes ago"
17806,Jay's getting really impatient and belligerent
17807,"We're all getting worried over here, derek and taylor have already assumed the worst"
17809,Yeah probably* my b
17810,"Like <#> , same question"
17811,"Haha figures, well I found the piece and priscilla's bowl"
17812,I accidentally brought em home in the box
17813,"Probably not, I'm almost out of gas and I get some cash tomorrow"
17814,Where do you need to go to get it?
17815,I think it's all still in my car
17816,<#> w jetton ave
17817,Also are you bringing galileo or dobby
17819,Id have to check but there's only like 1 bowls worth left
17820,I could ask carlos if we could get more if anybody else can chip in
17821,"Yo, any way we could pick something up tonight?"
17822,"Awesome, that gonna be soon or later tonight?"
17824,K see you in a bit
17825,How much are we getting?
17826,"K, makes sense, btw carlos is being difficult so you guys are gonna while I go pick up the second batch and get gas"
17827,A bloo bloo bloo I'll miss the first bowl
17829,K actually can you guys meet me at the sunoco on howard? It should be right on the way
17830,"The gas station is like a block away from my house, you'll drive right by it since armenia ends at swann and you have to take howard"
17832,"Sorry that took so long, omw now"
17833,"Alright we're hooked up, where you guys at"
17835,"Here, get the door"

17841,K here
17842,Yeah I can still give you a ride
17843,What why
17844,How would my ip address test that considering my computer isn't a minecraft server
17847,I ain't answerin no phone at what is actually a pretty reasonable hour but I'm sleepy
17848,How did you find out in a way that didn't include all of these details
17851,"This is one of the days you have a billion classes, right?"
17852,"Yeah that's what I thought, lemme know if anything's goin on later"
17853,Probably earlier than that if the station's where I think it is
17856,Please tell me you have some of that special stock you were talking about
17857,"Yeah, I'll leave in a couple minutes & let you know when I get to mu"
17859,You busy or can I come by at some point and figure out what we're doing tomorrow
17860,I'll talk to the others and probably just come early tomorrow then
17862,"fyi I'm at usf now, swing by the room whenever"
17863,"(And my man carlos is definitely coming by mu tonight, no excuses)"
17864,Carlos is taking his sweet time as usual so let me know when you and patty are done/want to and I'll tell him to haul
17867,"Yeah, we can probably swing by once my roommate finishes up with his girl"
17871,I'll let
17872,"Oops, I'll let you know when my roommate's done"
17873,Also where's the piece
17874,Negative on both
17876,Tell them the dealer's getting impatient
17877,Aight do you still want to get money
17878,"I've got ten bucks, jay is being noncomittal"
17879,jay says he'll put in <#>
17880,None of that's happening til you get here though
17881,"""Anymore""?"
17883,It was pretty eh
17885,"Same here, but I consider walls and bunkers and important just because I never play on peaceful but I guess your place is high enough that it don't matter"
17887,Well boy am I glad G wasted all night at applebees for nothing
17888,Speaking of does he have any cash yet?
17890,"You might want to pull out more just in case and just plan on not spending it if you can, I don't have much confidence in derek and taylor's money management"
17891,Yo you guys ever figure out how much we need for alcohol? Jay and I are trying to figure out how much we can safely spend on
17892,"<#> , that's all? Guess that's easy enough"
17894,"Awesome, I'll see you in a bit"
17895,Jason says it's cool if we pick some up from his place in like an hour
17898,What's your room number again? Wanna make sure I'm knocking on the right door
17899,"Just arrived, see you in a couple days <3"
17900,"Yep, at derek's house now, see you Sunday <3"
17901,Guess who spent all last night phasing in and out of the fourth dimension
17902,(It wasn't me)
17903,(You didn't hear it from me)
17906,<#> great loxahatchee xmas tree burning update: you can totally see stars here
17907,Prolly
17909,K I'll be there by 9
17910,Somebody should go to andros and steal ice
17911,Ugh it I'm resubbing to eve
17912,"Nothing really, just making sure everybody's up to speed"
17913,"I can make it up there, squeezed <#> bucks out of my dad"
17916,"Nah can't help you there, I've never had an iphone"
17919,We're aiming for 8
17920,Talk to g and x about that
17922,<#> w jetton ave if you forgot
17923,"Just dropped em off, omw back now"
17925,Well keep me posted
17926,"Jay told me already, will do"
17927,Then get some cash together and I'll text jason
17928,Yo you around?
17929,"K, jason says he's gonna be around so I'll be up there around <#>"
17930,"Haha, my legs and neck are killing me and my amigos are hoping to end the night with a burn, think I could swing by in like an hour?"
17931,"Cool, I'll text you when I'm on the way"
17934,Also remember the beads don't come off. Ever.
17935,You unbelievable faglord
17936,If I was I wasn't paying attention
17937,"Dad wanted to talk about the apartment so I got a late start, omw now"
17939,Fwiw the reason I'm only around when it's time to is that because of gas I can only afford to be around when someone tells me to be and that apparently only happens when somebody wants to light up
17940,"Sure, if I get an acknowledgement from you that it's astoundingly tactless and generally to demand a blood oath fo"
17941,From someone not to when every time I've in the last two weeks is because of you calling or texting me that you wanted to
17943,First*
17944,"I'm not coming over, do whatever you want"
17945,Haha you
17947,Well there's a pattern emerging of my friends telling me to drive up and come with them and then telling me that I'm a fiend/make them too much/impede their doing other things so you see how I'm hesitant
17949,"Looks like you found something to do other than smoke, great job!"
17950,You're not sure that I'm not trying to make xavier because I don't want to after being told I too much?
17951,"Wait that's still not all that clear, were you not sure about me being sarcastic or that that's why x doesn't want to live with us"
17953,I know I'm lacking on most of this particular dramastorm's details but for the most part I'm not worried about that
17954,I remain unconvinced that this isn't an elaborate test of my willpower
17955,Sounds like something that someone testing me would sayy
17956,Doesn't g have class early tomorrow and thus shouldn't be trying to at <#>
17957,It just seems like weird timing that the night that all you and g want is for me to come is the same day as when a shitstorm is attributed to me always coming over and making everyone
17958,Well keep in mind I've only got enough gas for one more round trip barring a sudden influx of cash
17959,(Btw I'm not coming)
17962,I think that tantrum's finished so yeah I'll be by at some point
17963,Btw regarding that we should really try to see if anyone else can be our 4th guy before we commit to a random dude
17964,Yeah that'd pretty much be the best case scenario
17965,Yeah if we do have to get a random dude we need to change our info sheets to PARTY <#> /7 NEVER STUDY just to be safe
17967,Yeah but which is worse for i
17968,"Derp. Which is worse, a dude who always wants to party or a dude who files a complaint about the three abusers he lives with"
17970,"Yeah hopefully, if tyler can't do it I could maybe ask around a bit"
17971,"Haha, that was the first person I was gonna ask"
17972,"Gumby's has a special where a <#> "" cheese pizza is $2 so I know what we're doin tonight"
17973,Sweeeeetg
17975,"Jus chillin, you?"
17976,"Yeah why not, is the gang all ready"
17980,Yaaaaaaay!!
17981,"Playin space poker, u?"
17982,Somebody set up a website where you can play hold em using eve online spacebucks
17983,I don't know but I'm raping dudes at poker
17985,You best watch what you say cause I get drunk as a
17986,You flippin your yet?
17988,"Sorry battery died, yeah I'm here"
17989,No my phone battery
17990,And I don't plan on staying the night but I prolly won't be back til late
17992,Lol yeah at this point I guess not
17993,"Oh fine, I'll be by tonight"
17994,"I'm omw now, be there a little after <#>"
17997,"Awesome, be there in a minute"
17998,Wylie here

18001,at bruce b downs & fletcher now
18003,Yep noted
18004,Unless it's a situation where YOU GO GURL would be more appropriate
18005,I don't know jack about anything or i'd say/ask something helpful but if you want you can pretend that I did and just text me whatever in response to the hypotheticalhuagauahahuagahyuhagga
18006,Acknowledged

18008,Yeah I'll try to scrounge something up
18009,Well there's still a bit left if you guys want to tonight
18011,Do I? I thought I put it back in the box
18012,Want to finally have lunch today?
18013,"I'll get there at 3, unless you guys want me to come some time sooner"
18016,If I get there before you after your ten billion calls and texts so help me
18017,"Will do, maybe monday"
18018,Yo guess what I just dropped
18020,I'll let you know when it kicks in
18021,Yeah like if it goes like it did with my friends imma flip my in like half an hour
18022,"I keep seeing weird and bein all ""woah"" then realising it's actually reasonable and I'm all ""oh"""

18330,Just woke up. Yeesh its late. But I didn't fall asleep til <#> am :/
18331,A little. Meds say take once every 8 hours. It's only been 5 but pain is back. So I took another. Hope I don't die
18332,I donno if they are scorable
18334,Yes I started to send requests to make it but pain came back so I'm back in bed. Double coins at the factory too. I gotta cash in all my nitros.
18336,Lol I was gonna last month. I cashed some in but I left <#> just in case. I was collecting more during the week cause they announced it on the blog.
18337,Doc prescribed me morphine cause the other pain meds aren't enough. Waiting for my mom to bring it. That med should kick in fast so I'm gonna try to be on later
18338,They have a thread on the wishlist section of the forums where ppl post nitro requests. Start from the last page and collect from the bottom up.
18339,And miss vday the parachute and double coins??? U must not know me very well...
18341,U don't know how stubborn I am. I didn't even want to go to the hospital. I kept telling Mark I'm not a weak sucker. Hospitals are for weak suckers.
18342,This girl does not stay in bed. This girl doesn't need recovery time. Id rather pass out while having fun then be cooped up in bed
18344,Oooh bed ridden ey? What are YOU thinking of?
18345,Lol grr my mom is taking forever with my prescription. Pharmacy is like 2 minutes away. Ugh.

18361,For real when u getting on yo? I only need 2 more tickets and one more jacket and I'm done. I already used all my multis.
18363,Haven't eaten all day. I'm sitting here staring at this juicy pizza and I can't eat it. These meds are ruining my life.
18364,Just forced myself to eat a slice. I'm really not hungry tho. This sucks. Mark is getting worried. He knows I'm sick when I turn down pizza. Lol
18365,No way I'm going back there!
18367,My stomach has been thru so much trauma I swear I just can't eat. I better lose weight.
18371,Do u have $ <#> I could borrow? Doc wants me to get a pelvic ultrasound on Monday and Mark doesn't get paid til Friday and mom said she's broke.

18996,Restless leg syndrome. I couldn't sleep til I got up and walked around. Then I woke up all over again.
18997,I guess its better than those cramps I get that wake me up. Last time I got the worst one of my life. It hurt to walk for 2 days :/
18998,I do get a kick out of Mark freaking out cause he's trying to figure out why I'm yelling.
19000,Oy. I just got an automated call from Sprint that if I don't pay my bill today they're turning off my phone. FML
19001,I've never had my phone turned off before. I feel so poor :'(
19003,Lol I forgot about that. But then no more texting u either :(
19004,Lol there's really a gay.com?
19005,So that's where u been hiding!
19006,Lol your crazy
19008,They can't all be that bad.
19010,Apparently me over eating this past weekend wasn't as bad as I thought. Taking walks afterward must be helping because I lost another 5 pounds. Woohoo!
19011,Call me when u can

19021,Ok. Mom said she wants to go to cheddars.
19022,Lol I like the Paris coin house but I'm too lazy to ask for cosigners. Plus my Italian house is still empty :/
19023,I donno. Maybe when they add yo babies.
19024,I haven't bought yo in so long they keep offering me a <#> % discount every time I log on.
19025,Long enough for us to make one ;) They will never let us earn cash. Peeps already have multis for coins. They'd go out of business.
19026,Eww licking our feet?
19028,Lol yeah she posted a sticky about it on the forums. And peep were saying they should remove it and ban her cause quit threads aren't allowed lol
19031,What would be the first thing you'd buy?
19032,Lol. I donno... u like blondes :/
19033,Lol deal
19035,Lol I don't remember sending that.
19036,Lol that's nothing. Yesterday mark was talking bout someone running 5k. And I was like oh that's not a lot of coins :/
19037,They turned off my phone this morning but its ok. Got my check today and paid my bill =D
19039,I know! Last time they cut off the internet the day I got paid. I really need to start playing the lotto.
19042,Ooh u slept in huh. Make those tips! We got lotto tickets to buy!
19043,No that wouldn't work. Id just lose all my money
19045,Deal!
19046,I thought u liked freaks. I like freaks.
19047,What did they do?
19048,Lmao omg
19050,Lol at least u got a laugh
19051,Come over here. I'll tip u REAL good
19052,Whenever. Pick a day.
19055,Lol hey don't forget u still owe me a date first.
19056,"McBride fell <#> stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty Bag filled with vegetable soup."
19057,So what u doin today?
19060,It's like when I go to autozone. They expect me to be dumb.
19061,Lmao yeah they're gonna think your a freak.
19062,Meanwhile I'm so happy cause mark is willingly getting his hair cut right now =D
19063,Oooh and guns n roses song just came on. Yay today is gonna be a good day!
19064,I know I get excited for the dumbest things but yesterday was a bad day. This is a good sign. Live and let die dum dum dum do do do
19065,Lol I know. Yesterday was so bad. Everything I did was wrong. I felt like Charlie Brown
19068,It's ok tho I got $ <#> credit at Kay jeweler
19072,Ok but he picks his nose a lot
19074,Sounds fun. Meanwhile I feel bad cause I missed a bridal shower. I just completely forgot but oh well I heard it was extremely boring.
19075,Lol mmmm chocolate pens...::drools::
19079,Were u still going to move moms furniture today?
19081,Doc convinced me to get my pupils dilated tho
19082,He said its covered.
19084,Copay*
19085,Why? I thought it was <#>
19086,Did u already pay?
19088,I mean it. Go ask
19090,Lol I know. And he suggested the contacts. So I asked him are u cheating on me?
19091,Lol I did. No evidence
19095,Lol oh yeah. Screw men Ill make my own money without poking ppl in the eye
19096,So how's work?
19098,Send it on over!
19100,It's cheaper to do a plan with me. Unlimited everything is required if u want a good phone. By yourself on Verizon with your discount is $ <#> /month. Adding to mine would be an extra $ <#> . That is for the plan. Phones are cheaper at best buy. HTC evo shift is $ <#> there. At sprint.com its $ <#> . It's a good deal.
19101,When is your next break?
19102,The weekend is almost here tho =D
19104,My moms bday on Sat. I got her a book with a pic of an old lady on it saying where did I leave my glasses...lol then I'll give her the real gift.
19105,I know. Like when she was taking FOREVER to bring my pain meds. I found out why too. She thought I legally changed my name to Cortez. So they couldn't find it.
19106,No! I never wanted to. But everyone kept hounding me about it. Even my dad asked Mark if he was really gonna 'let' me keep my last name. So I just changed it on FB to shut everyone up :/
19108,nobody I know uses a house phone. It's all cell phones.
19109,Cause I keep forgetting to buy lotto tickets
19110,Joanna got scammed. I warned her about it a week ago but she blew me off. Tsk tsk tsk
19111,They found a way to change the item they put in trade to look like an <#> costume. Your really getting a bikini bottom or something cheap. But on your end it will show up as the right costume. Ppl have been making threads about it on the forums for weeks now. Ninjas just close them and say they are false rumors.
19112,But it happened to Joanna today. She traded <#> k for pb bunny that ended up being pants. I warned her tho. She said she was gonna buy an <#> to resell later for profit. I told her all about it and to not to buy anything big for a while. She just said nah they will fix it by the time she saves up.
19113,Lol but I miss u :(
19114,Yes but u need to marry me first. I'm not quitting til I get married!
19115,Yes. You're taking to long
19116,That's your fault!

34792,"Hi Ricky, we received your email and portfolio, thanks. We areinterested in working with you on our house reno, but your quotationis too high and exceeds our budget for the amount of work and spacerenovated.

34794,"Hi Ricky, thanks for your SMS reply. Sorry I've been unable to replyearlier. Our budget is about <#> k, and we'd like to do up the frontof the house (outside gate) too.

Could we meet up this week tobring your proposal closer to a contract?"

34835,"Sure, no problem. :-) happy to help. We are slated to more outright before the rental period expires, but would definitelyappreciate if Desmond can give us some leeway for moving out at apro-rated rate, if we need to extend due to renovation delays. Itwould certainly make our move to the new place less stressful.Thanks!"
34836,"Hi Ricky, any news from the air con guys? BTW, we are going to haveour own electrician staff come down after all. They will be coming tothe house on Sat, time TBA. Thanks!"
34838,"Done with meeting, can pick you up from home or other place any time."
34840,"Hi Jiayu, my email is <EMAIL> . thanks!"
34841,"Hi Ricky, I did receive your guys electrical quote,but it did notitemize by area, so its impossible to decide what to take and what toforgo. I thought I forwarded it to you?"
34842,"The aircon quote seems to use the old, original drawings. Is theestimate based on the new third floor? The quote specifies that the2nd floor should take less BTUs than the 3rs which is wrong. We arealso thinking of only doing the guest room on the 1st floor, no hall.Can you double check?"
34843,"Finally, for the attic, can your guy design it as a trapdoor in theceiling? Then no other walls or doors on the attic level necessary.Thanks for your help!"
34844,"Hi Sis, happy weekend ahead. Just wondering, do you know theconfirmed time when your guys are planning to go to the house? Needto confirm with the designer whether ok. Thanks!"
34845,"Ok, will do. Am trying to confirm the timing for tomorrow and willtry to get the drawings to you for your consideration. In youradditional quote, why is the mirrors on the wardrobe chargeable? Ithought the wardrobe price was inclusive of any finishing. Is thatnot the case?"
34847,Thanks. See you then.
34848,Will do. Thanks. If we want other sink or wc than provided thenwhat's the method we should follow?
34849,"Ok, I see. Will discuss next time."
34851,"As for your feature wall design, we think your design is not quitethere and looks unfinished. I will repropose design and send to youfor your feedback. In particular, the partition and feature wall don'tlook connected or contiguous. Also, thought that you were going toconnect it to the cove light?"
34852,"Finally, since the maid's bathroom is demolished, we need to enlargethe wet kitchen. Will send you the new layout shortly."
34853,Will do. Thanks
34854,"Hi Sis, I've sent you the new wet kitchen layout according to ourdiscussion yesterday night to your yahoo account. Thanks for you andyour company's help again!"
34855,"Sure, can pass u keys tonight. Is that ok? Thanks! :-) :-)"
34856,"Hi Sis, the padlock is <#> . Front door currently not locked."
34857,Ok. Will do. Thanks :-)
34858,"Hi Ricky, we'll meet you tomorrow at IMM at around <#> : <#> as usual?"
34859,"I also tested a transfer to my premier account, but the test transferdidn't show up. Any idea why?"
34860,"Hi Diane, thanks for your answer. If I go to the HSBC branch, do youknow how long it takes to have a cheque's funds clear?"
34861,"Hi, you messaged me twice, but I'm not sure who you are. Can youcheck whether you sent to the correct person? Thanks."
34863,"Hi Ricky, can you get your people to take down the air con blower inthe 2nd floor old MBR? The electrical folks need it removed ASAP?Thanks!"
34864,"Hi Ricky, never mind about the last SMS, the electrical folks figureda way around it. Thanks, and sorry for the hassle."
34865,"Hi Sis, sorry but I don't know what a cct is. We don't have anyschematics or wiring diagrams of the house. The floorplan that youhave is the only blueprint that we know of. I will go back and doublecheck and let you know."
34866,Ok. That's perfect. No rush.
34869,Can you also let us know the cost for the attic door and whether thepartition can be built? Can you also send us the current floorplans?I still only have thee original ones.
34870,Ok. Thanks for the advice.
34871,"Ok, will try to pickup."
34872,"Hi Ricky, can you call Serene at KHK Asia <#> to arrange for theright timing to have the bathroom fixtures and 3rd floor bathtub andrain shower delivered? Thanks. Please note that the filler of thetub is the same as the waste itself (please ask serene to clarifyif unsure). The 2nd floor bathtub also will use a basin filler, asdiscussed earlier."

47334,Fuuuuck. Have you seen a wallet around?
47335,Oh man I'm screwed =(
47339,Fuck I literally don't know what to do. If I don't find it I willhave no more than five bucks for a month because there's no accessiblewf
47340,Did Mark switch classes?
47341,Is he going?
47342,"Alright, thanks love.. this sucks"
47343,"Alright.. <name> said he'd loan me money if I need it till then =)Fuck I can't even see walking in the rain, no joke"
47344,Yup.. two min if walking and I gave up avoiding puddles
47345,"Yeah xP debit will be here in <#> , the other guy rushed my creditfor <#> which is fine =D"
47346,Yeah.. so uh how will I fly without id?
47347,Nope. I have a umich id and a birth certificate.. I have my soc cardand temp licence paper too I guess
47348,Alright =/
47349,Ohhhh snap
47350,"This just sucks so much. You know the up part? If I just letmyself have my compulsions, I would've been checking for it"
47351,Something wrong? We can call if you want love
47352,Oh it's fine lol

47357,Hahahhahaha
47360,Yeah haha.. Btw I'm crazy drowsy.. we can call if you want and if Istop responding wake my up
47361,XP
47362,"Alright, you?"
47363,Justin?
47364,That's not so strange lol. Just because you're unnecessarily hostiletowards any notion of religion.. =P
47365,"Iiii dunno. User your best judgement, we've been together for the years =P"
47366,Tshirt stage?
47367,People are religious. They have beliefs. And not just because theywere forced to -.-
47368,That's as bad as psycho religious people lol
47369,Ohhhh
47370,You're the atheist equivalent of the Christian who screams thatyou'll go to if you read Harry Potter
47371,I'm sure they think they're not like that too lol
47372,"Sorry, I just don't understand why you hate it so much"
47373,"Okay, look down on it so much"
47374,"In general I guess so, but if I knew one not like that - and I knowtons of great English majors - I'd see exceptions. You know Justinisn't just"
47375,I wouldn't if she'd proven herself to be a cool person.. instead shesaid she was going to knock on each door to find me the first nighthere
47377,Soo
47378,"I guess... I just can't see it as a negative thing myself and don'tnecessarily find it even that illogical... if anything, it's a topicyou could literally never have an actual answer for"
47381,"No it's not. Religious people denying certain scientific facts likeevolution or the big or something are dumb and illogical and Ican't respect that either, but religion in conjunction with sense isfine... People like Justin likely don't think they're literallyreading Christ's flesh, and I'm not arguing for every religious personout there... lots ARE batshit insane, like my grandma ""healing mewith the power of Jesus"", trust me I'm not defending that"
47384,"At Unitarian churches you get lots of people from different religionswho just want a good community and chance to believe what they want,not really all that dumb I don't think... they're normal people whoagree with intellectual truths and happen to think ""oh somethinggodlike is out there"""
47385,I don't think you do
47386,I just don't understand why it's incompatible with reasonable thoughtif you take science over religion while still holding religiousbeliefs
47387,"Saying Earth is 6k years old or that woman came from a rib orwhatever is ridiculous... the actual entity isn't in my opinion. Ifscience could prove within reason that a kind if didn't exist,it'd be ridiculous to believe in"
47388,"I see a problem with believing in things counter to evidence we have,but not things without evidence"
47389,"Saying creationism is real is nuts, because we can reasonably price that it is"
47390,Prove
47391,"Because it doesn't serve any purpose I guess... I don't know,religion is half to understand what you can't, primarily death. Thereis no other purpose for the unicorns and any other explanation oftotally unknown stuff could be just as wrong"
47392,"Oh I know, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm sitting herethinking you're just a terrible person who hates him or that I'm onsome elevated plane of whatever lol... I just can tell you what weirdthings you do and get an explanation, whereas, say, Hemisha wouldscoff and berate you if you tried to have a similar conversation lol"
47394,Wtf really?
