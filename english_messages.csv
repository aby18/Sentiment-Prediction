11202,Boring. Bored. Waiting for david. I know he's gonna kill.
11203,Everybody on the feed is talkin about how the band is str8 killin! And apparently some girl named kayla is supposed to be good.
11204,But i don't think the bgvs look horrible. Look how much space they have to work with.
11205,Just no excitement in these voices.
11206,Smh.
11207,"Ok, when you get home ima play the real version of this song. She kinda sux."
11208,So glad i'm not there. he is just annoying. Usher?? Really?
11209,The bread? It's GOOD!!
11210,Is it alright if i pay you back for the movie ticket with my free ticket i had forgotten to bring? Or do you need the cash?
11211,I'm not coming home then! I'm tired of crying!
11212,Nuh-uh. Before bed on tuesday.
11213,I'll cry.
11214,"I'm gonna be home soon and i don't want to talk about this stuff anymore tonight, k? I've cried enough today."
11215,Of course. I guess god's just got me on hold right now.
11216,You've already got a flaky parent. It'snot supposed to be the child's job to support the parent...not until they're The Ride age anyway. I'm supposed to be there to support you. And now i've hurt you. unintentional. But hurt nonetheless.
11217,Which is why i never wanted to tell you any of this. Which is why i'm so short with you and on-edge as of late.
11218,Most of the tiime when i don't let you hug me it's so i don't break into tears.
11219,No. It's not pride. I'm almost <#> years old and shouldn't be takin money from my kid. You're not supposed to have to deal with this stuff. This is grownup stuff--why i don't tell you.
11220,It's sooooo not.
11221,Are you busy tonight?
11222,says the <#> year old with a man and money. I'm down to my last <#> . Still waiting for that check.
11223,"It's not that you make me cry. It's just that when all our stuff happens on top of everything else, it pushes me over the edge. You don't underdtand how often i cry over my sorry, sorry life."
11224,"No i'm not. I can't give you everything you want and need. You actually could do better for yourself on yor own--you've got more money than i do. I can't get work, i can't get a man, i can't pay the rent, i can't even fill my gas tank. yes, i'm stressed and depressed. I didn't even call home for thanksgiving cuz i'll have to tell them i,m up to nothing."
11225,Idk. I'm sitting here in a stop and shop parking lot right now bawling my eyes out because i feel like i'm a failure in everything. Nobody wants me and now i feel like i'm failing you.
11226,I don't want you to leave. But i'm barely doing what i can to stay sane. fighting with you constantly isn't helping.
11227,"Idk. You keep saying that you're not, but since he moved, we keep butting heads over freedom vs. responsibility. And i'm tired. I have so much other to deal with that i'm barely keeping myself together once this gets added to it."
11228,You are right though. I can't give you the space you want and need. This is really starting to become an issue. I was going to suggest setting a definite move out--if i'm still there-- after greece. But maybe you are ready and should do it now.
11229,I am sorry it hurt you.
11230,"You are always putting your business out there. You put pictures of your on facebook. You are one of the most open people i've ever met. Why would i think a picture of your room would hurt you, make you feel violated."
11231,"The last thing i ever wanted to do was hurt you. And i didn't think it would have. You'd laugh, be embarassed, delete the tag and keep going. But as far as i knew, it wasn't even up. The fact that you even felt like i would do it to hurt you shows you really don't know me at all. It was messy wednesday, but it wasn't bad. The problem i have with it is you HAVE the time to clean it, but you choose not to. You skype, you take pictures, you sleep, you want to go out. I don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else. You used to be good about at least making the bed."
11232,Please don't text me anymore. I have nothing else to say.
11233,"I'm done. I'm sorry. I hope your next space gives you everything you want. Remember all the furniture is yours. If i'm not around when you move it, just lock all the locks and leave the key with jenne."
11234,I tagged MY friends that you seemed to count as YOUR friends.
11235,"Wow. I never realized that you were so embarassed by your accomodations. I thought you liked it, since i was doing the best i could and you always seemed so happy about ""the cave"". I'm sorry I didn't and don't have more to give. I'm sorry i offered. I'm sorry your room was so embarassing."
11236,"I NEVERsaid dirty. That is YOUR word, not mine."
11237,You said to me before i went back to bed that you can't sleep for anything.
11238,"no, i *didn't* mean to post it. I wrote it, and like so many other times i've ritten stuff to you, i let it sit there. it WAS what i was feeling at the time. I was angry. Before i left, i hit send, then stop. It wasn't there. I checked on my phone when i got to my car. It wasn't there. You said you didn't sleep, you were bored. So why wouldn't THAT be the time to clean, fold laundry, etc.? At least make the bed?"
11239,"I can't keep going through this. It was never my intention to run you out, but if you choose to do that rather than keep the room clean so *I* don't have to say no to visitors, then maybe that's the best choice. Yes, I wanted you to be embarassed, so maybe you'd feel for once how I feel when i have a friend who wants to drop buy and i have to say no, as happened this morning. I've tried everything. I don't know what else to do."
11240,Yes. that will be fine. Love you. Be safe.
11241,it's still not working. And this time i also tried adding zeros. That was the savings. The checking is <#>
11242,<#> Didn't work. And i tried it without the zeros.
11243,what is your account number?
11244,No prob
11245,Ya sure?
11246,<#> and <#> @ braintree
11247,"!!! ""Nana wants me to stay in the city, so I guess I'll just see u in the morning. Me n jaleah will be at home at like 9."""
11248,Home and in bed!
11249,Didn't get.
11250,No. Did you multimedia message them or e-mail?
11251,Send me a pic!
11252,Is that what time you want me to come?
11253,Alright. I'm out--have a good night!
11254,And Chuck.
11255,I absolutely LOVE South Park! I only recently started watching the office.
11256,What do you watch?
11257,i thought we were doing a king of the hill thing there.
11258,;-D
11259,"I guess you could be as good an excuse as any, lol."
11260,I'm always looking for an excuse to be in the city.
11261,That means from february to april i'll be getting a place to stay down there so i don't have to hustle back and forth during audition season as i have since my sister moved away from harlem.
11262,"chile, please! It's only a <DECIMAL> hour drive for me. I come down all the time and will be subletting feb-april for audition season."
11263,"Especially since i talk about boston all up in my personal statement, lol! I woulda changed that if i had realized it said nyc! It says boston now."
11264,"wow. You're right! I didn't mean to do that. I guess once i gave up on boston men and changed my search location to nyc, something changed. Cuz on my signin page it still says boston."
11265,No sir. That's why i had an 8-hr trip on the bus last week. Have another audition next wednesday but i think i might drive this time.
11266,Yes. I come to nyc for audiitions and am trying to relocate.
11267,"I'm used to it. I just hope my agents don't drop me since i've only booked a few things this year. This whole me in boston, them in nyc was an experiment."
11268,Sorry. You never hear unless you book it. One was kinda a joke--thet were really looking for skinny white girls. The other was one line--you can only do so much on camera with that. Something like that they're casting on the look.
11269,Unlimited texts. Limited minutes.
11270,It would have to be after 9. I don't have minutes.
11271,That's great.
11272,I'm fine. And u?
11273,What's your new addy?
11274,have a good night!
11275,You up? Taking calls?
11276,"Ditto. And you won't have to worry about me saying ANYTHING to you anymore. Like i said last night, you do whatever you want and i'll do the same. Peace."
11277,"For you information, IKEA is spelled with all caps. That is not yelling. when you thought i had left you, you were sitting on the bed among the mess when i came in. i said we were going after you got home from class. please don't try and me. It makes me want to listen to you less."
11278,Bull. Your plan was to go floating off to IKEA with me without a care in the world. So i have to live with your mess another day.
11279,"The fact that you're cleaning shows you know why i'm upset. Your priority is constantly ""what i want to do,"" not ""what i need to do."""
11280,"And that is the problem. You walk around in ""julianaland"" oblivious to what is going on around you. I say the same things constantly and they go in one ear and out the other while you go off doing whatever you want to do. It's not that you don't know why I'm upset--it's that you don't listen when i tell you WHAT is going to upset me. Then you want to be surprised when I'm mad."
11281,Who me?
11282,Any chance you might have had with me evaporated as soon as you violated my privacy by stealing my phone number from your employer's paperwork. Not cool at all. Please do not contact me again or I will report you to your supervisor.
11283,"I'm tired of arguing with you about this week after week. Do what you want and from now on, i'll do the same."
11284,DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
11285,"Do whatever you want. You know what the rules are. We had a talk earlier this week about what had to start happening, you showing responsibility. Yet, every week it's can i bend the rule this way? What about that way? Do whatever. I'm tired of having thia same argument with you every week. And a <#> movie DOESNT inlude the previews. You're still getting in after 1."
11286,"Whatever, juliana. Do whatever you want."
11287,I accidentally deleted the message. Resend please.
11288,"see, i knew giving you a break a few times woul lead to you always wanting to miss curfew. I was gonna gibe you 'til one, but a MIDNIGHT movie is not gonna get out til after 2. You need to come home. You need to getsleep and, if anything, you need to b studdying ear training."
11289,"I don,t think so. You don't need to be going out that late on a school night. ESPECIALLY when the one class you have is the one you missed last wednesday and probably failed a test in on friday"
11290,"Oh really? perform, write a paper, go to a movie AND be home by midnight, huh?"
11291,"Hmph. Go head, big baller."
11292,Nope. Sorry!
11293,"Well, i'm gonna finish my bath now. Have a good...fine night."
11294,Alrighty then.
11295,"Ok, Mr. Vague, lol."
11296,I actually did for the first time in a while. I went to bed not too long after i spoke with you. Woke up at 7. How was your night?
11297,Hola. How are you?
11298,alright. Thanks for the advice. Enjoy your night out. I'ma try to get some sleep...
11299,This is all just creepy and crazy to me.
11300,"So you think i should actually talk to him? Not call his boss in the morning? I went to this place last year and he told me where i could go and get my car fixed cheaper. He kept telling me today how much he hoped i would come back in, how he always regretted not getting my number, etc."
11301,As if i wasn't having enough trouble sleeping.
11302,"The guy at the car shop who was flirting with me got my phone number from the paperwork and called and texted me. I'm nervous because of course now he may have my address. Should i call his boss and tell him, knowing this may get him fired?"
11303,Can i get your opinion on something first?
11304,"Sorry about earlier. Putting out fires.Are you around to talk after 9? Or do you actually have a life, lol!"
11305,"Oh, i will get paid. The most outstanding one is for a commercial i did for Hasbro...in AUGUST! They made us jump through so many hoops to get paid. Still not."
11306,What type of stuff do you sing?
11307,Probably money worries. Things are coming due and i have several outstanding invoices for work i did two and three months ago.
11308,Oh really?? Did you make it on air? What's your talent?
11309,Tired. I haven't slept well the past few nights.
11310,"It,,s a taxt massage....tie-pos argh ok! Lool!"
11311,"Nice. Wait...should you be texting right now? I'm not gonna pay your ticket, ya know!"
11312,What do you do?
11313,"I'm an actor. When i work, i work in the evening and sleep late. Since i'm unemployed at the moment, i ALWAYS sleep late. When you're unemployed, every day is saturday."
11314,Ahhh. Work. I vaguely remember that! What does it feel like? Lol
11315,Why are u up so early?
11316,Good morning. At the repair shop--the ONLY reason i'm up at this hour.
11317,Have a good show!
11318,Start
11319,I was about to do it when i texted. I finished a long time ago and showered and er'ything!
11320,"You aren't coming home between class, right? I need to work out and shower!"
11321,SP <#> CMD=REGISTER;ID=4;IMEI= <#> ;SIM= <#> ;MCC= <#> ;MNC= <#> ;
11322,What???? Hello wats talks email address?
11323,Why don't you wait 'til at least wednesday to see if you get your .
11324,"Coffee cake, i guess..."
11325,"If i let you do this, i want you in the house by 8am."
11326,Re your call; You didn't see my facebook huh?
11327,Oh dang! I didn't mean o send that to you! Lol!
11328,"Haven't seen my facebook, huh? Lol!"
11329,And of course you should make a stink!
11330,No go. No openings for that room 'til after thanksgiving without an upcharge.
11331,You need to get up. Now.

11936,"Yes, princess. Are you going to make me moan?"
11937,"And how you will do that, princess? :)"
11938,Love it! The girls at the office may wonder why you are smiling but sore...
11939,"How long has it been since you screamed, princess?"
11940,"Why is that, princess? I bet the brothas are all chasing you!"
11941,ok. I am a gentleman and will treat you with dignity and respect.

13679,"Nothing. I meant that once the money enters your account here, the bank will remove its flat rate. Someone transfered <#> to my account and <#> dollars got removed. So the banks differ and charges also differ.be sure you trust the 9ja person you are sending account details to cos..."
13680,About <#> bucks. The banks fees are fixed. Better to call the bank and find out.

I want to send a file to someone but it won't go over yahoo for them because their connection sucks, remember when you set up that page for me to go to and download the format disc ?

14779,Sounds like there could be a lot of time spent in that chastity device boy ... *grins* ... Or take your beatings like a good dog. Going to lounge in a nice long bath now ?

That <#> dollars is 2years sent and that you know its a strain but i plan to pay back every dime he gives. Every dime so for me to expect anything from you is not practical. Something like that.

15327,You have to pls make a note of all she.s exposed to. Also find out from her school if anyone else was vomiting. Is there a dog or cat in the house? Let me know later.

15339,Ok. There may be a free gym about.
15340,Is the gym not free?

15342,Come on skype

And if you give her malaria meds now she will just vomit. Its a self limiting illness she has which means in a few days it will completely stop"
15370,What is important is that you prevent dehydration by giving her enough fluids
15371,"Give her something to drink, if she takes it and doesn't vomit then you her temp might drop. If she unmits however let me know."
15372,But if she.s drinkin i'm ok.
15373,Is she drinkin
15374,What's up.
15375,Just getting back home

17771,"A gram usually runs like <#> , a half eighth is smarter though and gets you almost a whole second gram for <#>"
17772,"Hey, you around?"
17773,"Not sure yet, still trying to get a hold of him"
17774,Welp apparently he retired
17775,"sry can't talk on phone, with parents"
17776,"The guy (kadeem) hasn't been selling since the break, I know one other guy but he's paranoid as and doesn't like selling without me there and I can't be up there til late tonight"
17777,Midnight at the earliest
17778,"Hey, a guy I know is breathing down my neck to get him some bud, anyway you'd be able to get a half track to usf tonight?"
17779,"(I should add that I don't really care and if you can't I can at least get this dude to off but hey, your money if you want it)"
17780,"Yep, by the pretty sculpture"
17781,We're on the opposite side from where we dropped you off
17782,Dad says hurry the up
17783,Holy living christ what is taking you so long
17784,"Video games, you?"

17789,Jay up yet?
17790,Aight should I just plan to come up later tonight?
17791,"That's cool, I'll come by like <#> ish"
17792,Alex knows a guy who sells mids but he's down in south tampa and I don't think I could set it up before like 8
17793,And also I've sorta blown him off a couple times recently so id rather not text him out of the blue looking for
17794,"Awesome, I remember the last time we got somebody high for the first time with diesel :V"
17795,"Aight, I should be there by 8 at the latest, probably closer to 7. Are jay and tyler down or should we just do two trips?"
17796,1 I don't have her number and 2 its gonna be a massive pain in the and i'd rather not get involved if that's possible
17797,"I don't have anybody's number, I still haven't thought up a tactful way to ask alex"
17798,What I'm saying is if you haven't explicitly told nora I know someone I'm probably just not gonna bother
17799,Ok I'm gonna head up to usf in like fifteen minutes
17800,"Haha nice, will do"
17801,I'm at mu
17802,(Where are you)
17803,"Hurry up, I've been weed-deficient for like three days"
17804,Also where's dobby at
17805,"""Gimme a few"" was <#> minutes ago"
17806,Jay's getting really impatient and belligerent
17807,"We're all getting worried over here, derek and taylor have already assumed the worst"
17808,Still here so nyea
17809,Yeah probably* my b
17810,"Like <#> , same question"
17811,"Haha figures, well I found the piece and priscilla's bowl"
17812,I accidentally brought em home in the box
17813,"Probably not, I'm almost out of gas and I get some cash tomorrow"
17814,Where do you need to go to get it?
17815,I think it's all still in my car
17816,<#> w jetton ave
17817,Also are you bringing galileo or dobby
17818,"Uh, heads up we don't have THAT much left"
17819,Id have to check but there's only like 1 bowls worth left
17820,I could ask carlos if we could get more if anybody else can chip in
17821,"Yo, any way we could pick something up tonight?"
17822,"Awesome, that gonna be soon or later tonight?"
17823,Carlos says we can pick up from him later so yeah we're set
17824,K see you in a bit
17825,How much are we getting?
17826,"K, makes sense, btw carlos is being difficult so you guys are gonna while I go pick up the second batch and get gas"
17827,A bloo bloo bloo I'll miss the first bowl
17828,"He will, you guys close?"
17829,K actually can you guys meet me at the sunoco on howard? It should be right on the way
17830,"The gas station is like a block away from my house, you'll drive right by it since armenia ends at swann and you have to take howard"
17831,I AM AT THE GAS STATION. GO THERE.
17832,"Sorry that took so long, omw now"
17833,"Alright we're hooked up, where you guys at"
17834,K omw
17835,"Here, get the door"
17836,Yes when is the appt again?
17837,K and you're sure I don't have to have consent forms to do it :V
17838,You're right I have now that I think about it
17839,R u 4 real
17840,K be there in a few
17841,K here
17842,Yeah I can still give you a ride
17843,What why
17844,How would my ip address test that considering my computer isn't a minecraft server
17845,Loool
17846,Its 1 am
17847,I ain't answerin no phone at what is actually a pretty reasonable hour but I'm sleepy
17848,How did you find out in a way that didn't include all of these details
17849,Jesus armand really is trying to tell everybody he can find
17850,I am literally in bed and have been up for like <#> hours
17851,"This is one of the days you have a billion classes, right?"
17852,"Yeah that's what I thought, lemme know if anything's goin on later"
17853,Probably earlier than that if the station's where I think it is
17854,Yeah imma come over cause jay wants to do some drugs
17855,That means get the door
17856,Please tell me you have some of that special stock you were talking about
17857,"Yeah, I'll leave in a couple minutes & let you know when I get to mu"
17858,I'll be at mu in like <#> seconds
17859,You busy or can I come by at some point and figure out what we're doing tomorrow
17860,I'll talk to the others and probably just come early tomorrow then
17861,"Sorry I flaked last night, shit's seriously goin down with my roommate, what you up to tonight?"
17862,"fyi I'm at usf now, swing by the room whenever"
17863,"(And my man carlos is definitely coming by mu tonight, no excuses)"
17864,Carlos is taking his sweet time as usual so let me know when you and patty are done/want to and I'll tell him to haul
17865,In other news after hassling me to get him for a week andres has no money. HAUGHAIGHGTUJHYGUJ
17866,"""Not really"""
17867,"Yeah, we can probably swing by once my roommate finishes up with his girl"
17868,Meanwhile in the suite: xavier decided to give us <#> seconds of warning that samantha was coming over and is playing jay's guitar to impress her or some shit. Also I don't think doug realizes I don't live here anymore
17869,Jay is snickering and tells me that x is totally up the chords as we speak
17870,"Sweet, we may or may not go to 4U to meet carlos so gauge patty's interest in that"
17871,I'll let
17872,"Oops, I'll let you know when my roommate's done"
17873,Also where's the piece
17874,Negative on both
17875,How long does applebees take
17876,Tell them the dealer's getting impatient
17877,Aight do you still want to get money
17878,"I've got ten bucks, jay is being noncomittal"
17879,jay says he'll put in <#>
17880,None of that's happening til you get here though
17881,"""Anymore""?"
17882,Jay says that you're a double-faggot
17883,It was pretty eh
17884,You do got a shitload of diamonds though
17885,"Same here, but I consider walls and bunkers and important just because I never play on peaceful but I guess your place is high enough that it don't matter"
17886,"No idea, I guess we'll work that out an hour after we're supposed to leave since as usual nobody has any interest in figuring out before the last second"
17887,Well boy am I glad G wasted all night at applebees for nothing
17888,Speaking of does he have any cash yet?
17889,"You at mu? You should try to figure out how much money everyone has for gas and alcohol, jay and I are trying to figure out our budget"
17890,"You might want to pull out more just in case and just plan on not spending it if you can, I don't have much confidence in derek and taylor's money management"
17891,Yo you guys ever figure out how much we need for alcohol? Jay and I are trying to figure out how much we can safely spend on
17892,"<#> , that's all? Guess that's easy enough"
17893,Think I could stop by in like an hour or so? My roommate's looking to stock up for a trip
17894,"Awesome, I'll see you in a bit"
17895,Jason says it's cool if we pick some up from his place in like an hour
17896,"Sorry my roommates took forever, it ok if I come by now?"
17897,"Cool, be there in 5"
17898,What's your room number again? Wanna make sure I'm knocking on the right door
17899,"Just arrived, see you in a couple days <3"
17900,"Yep, at derek's house now, see you Sunday <3"
17901,Guess who spent all last night phasing in and out of the fourth dimension
17902,(It wasn't me)
17903,(You didn't hear it from me)
17904,"Yep, the great loxahatchee xmas tree burning of <#> starts in an hour"
17905,Where all y'all at
17906,<#> great loxahatchee xmas tree burning update: you can totally see stars here
17907,Prolly
17908,"Are you sure you don't mean ""get here, we made you hold all the weed"""
17909,K I'll be there by 9
17910,Somebody should go to andros and steal ice
17911,Ugh it I'm resubbing to eve
17912,"Nothing really, just making sure everybody's up to speed"
17913,"I can make it up there, squeezed <#> bucks out of my dad"
17914,Also andros ice etc etc
17915,"K I'm leaving soon, be there a little after 9"
17916,"Nah can't help you there, I've never had an iphone"
17917,"Probably not, still going over some stuff here"
17918,Omw home now though
17919,We're aiming for 8
17920,Talk to g and x about that
17921,I'm already back home so no probably not
17922,<#> w jetton ave if you forgot
17923,"Just dropped em off, omw back now"
17924,I'll probably be by tomorrow (or even later tonight if something's going on)
17925,Well keep me posted
17926,"Jay told me already, will do"
17927,Then get some cash together and I'll text jason
17928,Yo you around?
17929,"K, jason says he's gonna be around so I'll be up there around <#>"
17930,"Haha, my legs and neck are killing me and my amigos are hoping to end the night with a burn, think I could swing by in like an hour?"
17931,"Cool, I'll text you when I'm on the way"
17932,Also remember to get dobby's bowl from your car
17933,Also track down any lighters you can find
17934,Also remember the beads don't come off. Ever.
17935,You unbelievable faglord
17936,If I was I wasn't paying attention
17937,"Dad wanted to talk about the apartment so I got a late start, omw now"
17938,"Sorry, got a late start, we're on the way"
17939,Fwiw the reason I'm only around when it's time to is that because of gas I can only afford to be around when someone tells me to be and that apparently only happens when somebody wants to light up
17940,"Sure, if I get an acknowledgement from you that it's astoundingly tactless and generally to demand a blood oath fo"
17941,From someone not to when every time I've in the last two weeks is because of you calling or texting me that you wanted to
17942,"I'll see if I can swing by in a bit, got some things to take care of here firsg"
17943,First*
17944,"I'm not coming over, do whatever you want"
17945,Haha you
17946,Maybe you should find something else to do instead???
17947,Well there's a pattern emerging of my friends telling me to drive up and come with them and then telling me that I'm a fiend/make them too much/impede their doing other things so you see how I'm hesitant
17948,"Tell you what, if you make a little spreadsheet and track whose idea it was to to determine who ""smokes too much"" for the entire month of february, I'll come up"
17949,"Looks like you found something to do other than smoke, great job!"
17950,You're not sure that I'm not trying to make xavier because I don't want to after being told I too much?
17951,"Wait that's still not all that clear, were you not sure about me being sarcastic or that that's why x doesn't want to live with us"
17952,"I'm not while people use ""wylie smokes too much"" to justify ruining my"
17953,I know I'm lacking on most of this particular dramastorm's details but for the most part I'm not worried about that
17954,I remain unconvinced that this isn't an elaborate test of my willpower
17955,Sounds like something that someone testing me would sayy
17956,Doesn't g have class early tomorrow and thus shouldn't be trying to at <#>
17957,It just seems like weird timing that the night that all you and g want is for me to come is the same day as when a shitstorm is attributed to me always coming over and making everyone
17958,Well keep in mind I've only got enough gas for one more round trip barring a sudden influx of cash
17959,(Btw I'm not coming)
17960,Why don't you go tell your friend you're not sure you want to live with him because he smokes too much then spend hours begging him to come
17961,About it
17962,I think that tantrum's finished so yeah I'll be by at some point
17963,Btw regarding that we should really try to see if anyone else can be our 4th guy before we commit to a random dude
17964,Yeah that'd pretty much be the best case scenario
17965,Yeah if we do have to get a random dude we need to change our info sheets to PARTY <#> /7 NEVER STUDY just to be safe
17966,"No we put party 7 days a week and study lightly, I think we need to draw in some custom checkboxes so they know we're hardcore"
17967,Yeah but which is worse for i
17968,"Derp. Which is worse, a dude who always wants to party or a dude who files a complaint about the three abusers he lives with"
17969,You should change your fb to jaykwon thuglyfe falconerf
17970,"Yeah hopefully, if tyler can't do it I could maybe ask around a bit"
17971,"Haha, that was the first person I was gonna ask"
17972,"Gumby's has a special where a <#> "" cheese pizza is $2 so I know what we're doin tonight"
17973,Sweeeeetg
17974,Ugh typos
17975,"Jus chillin, you?"
17976,"Yeah why not, is the gang all ready"
17977,Then I'm on mah way
17978,I'm here
17979,Nothing I guess
17980,Yaaaaaaay!!
17981,"Playin space poker, u?"
17982,Somebody set up a website where you can play hold em using eve online spacebucks
17983,I don't know but I'm raping dudes at poker
17984,on a Tuesday night r u 4 real
17985,You best watch what you say cause I get drunk as a

17991,"Sure, I'll see if I can come by in a bit"
17992,Lol yeah at this point I guess not
17993,"Oh fine, I'll be by tonight"
17994,"I'm omw now, be there a little after <#>"
17995,Yo what you up to?
17996,"Haha better late than ever, any way I could swing by?"
17997,"Awesome, be there in a minute"

18006,Acknowledged
18007,Not a drop in the tank
18008,Yeah I'll try to scrounge something up
18009,Well there's still a bit left if you guys want to tonight
18010,I meant just you guys
18011,Do I? I thought I put it back in the box
18012,Want to finally have lunch today?
18013,"I'll get there at 3, unless you guys want me to come some time sooner"
18014,"Usf I guess, might as well take 1 car"
18015,In that case I guess I'll see you at campus lodge

18336,Lol I was gonna last month. I cashed some in but I left <#> just in case. I was collecting more during the week cause they announced it on the blog.
18337,Doc prescribed me morphine cause the other pain meds aren't enough. Waiting for my mom to bring it. That med should kick in fast so I'm gonna try to be on later
18338,They have a thread on the wishlist section of the forums where ppl post nitro requests. Start from the last page and collect from the bottom up.
18339,And miss vday the parachute and double coins??? U must not know me very well...
18340,That's cause your old. I live to be high.
18341,U don't know how stubborn I am. I didn't even want to go to the hospital. I kept telling Mark I'm not a weak sucker. Hospitals are for weak suckers.
18342,This girl does not stay in bed. This girl doesn't need recovery time. Id rather pass out while having fun then be cooped up in bed
18343,Weak suckers.
18344,Oooh bed ridden ey? What are YOU thinking of?

18370,Yeah I imagine he would be really gentle. Unlike the other docs who treat their patients like turkeys.
18371,Do u have $ <#> I could borrow? Doc wants me to get a pelvic ultrasound on Monday and Mark doesn't get paid til Friday and mom said she's broke.
18372,Mark works tomorrow. He gets out at 5. His work is by your house so he can meet u afterwards.
18373,U guys never invite me anywhere :(

18996,Restless leg syndrome. I couldn't sleep til I got up and walked around. Then I woke up all over again.
18997,I guess its better than those cramps I get that wake me up. Last time I got the worst one of my life. It hurt to walk for 2 days :/

19024,I haven't bought yo in so long they keep offering me a <#> % discount every time I log on.
19025,Long enough for us to make one ;) They will never let us earn cash. Peeps already have multis for coins. They'd go out of business.
19026,Eww licking our feet?
19027,Lol my cat has a foot fetish. He's always playing with my feet when I try to walk.

19038,When is your last break?
19039,I know! Last time they cut off the internet the day I got paid. I really need to start playing the lotto.

19057,So what u doin today?
19058,LOL please tell
19059,Aw its ok. Just ask for help. Your a guy so nobody expects u to know anything.
19060,It's like when I go to autozone. They expect me to be dumb.
19061,Lmao yeah they're gonna think your a freak.
19062,Meanwhile I'm so happy cause mark is willingly getting his hair cut right now =D
19063,Oooh and guns n roses song just came on. Yay today is gonna be a good day!
19064,I know I get excited for the dumbest things but yesterday was a bad day. This is a good sign. Live and let die dum dum dum do do do
19065,Lol I know. Yesterday was so bad. Everything I did was wrong. I felt like Charlie Brown
19066,Hurry
19067,I'm such a sucker. My main diamond was loose on my wedding ring so I went to get it tightened. But they talked me into replacing it cause it was a lil chipped get the ring engraved and put the old diamond on a pendant.
19068,It's ok tho I got $ <#> credit at Kay jeweler
19069,Do u like red heads?
19070,Just a random curious question =D do u?
19071,On what? If he's muscular and rich? Lol jk
19072,Ok but he picks his nose a lot
19073,How's your day going so far?
19074,Sounds fun. Meanwhile I feel bad cause I missed a bridal shower. I just completely forgot but oh well I heard it was extremely boring.
19075,Lol mmmm chocolate pens...::drools::
19076,Lol yeah. But this was a boring one remember
19077,Lol leave me alone!
19078,Your terrible!
19079,Were u still going to move moms furniture today?
19080,U exaggerate about the blue light
19081,Doc convinced me to get my pupils dilated tho
19082,He said its covered.
19083,How much is the copy?
19084,Copay*
19085,Why? I thought it was <#>
19086,Did u already pay?
19087,Ok well see. Ask how come the Copay is high.
19088,I mean it. Go ask
19089,After years of nagging I finally got mark to get contacts Woohoo!
19090,Lol I know. And he suggested the contacts. So I asked him are u cheating on me?
19091,Lol I did. No evidence
19092,I checked online. In case he deleted anything off his phone. I know I'm terrible. But I had to check.
19093,We went to the eye doc today. I was gonna txt u earlier but they dilated my eyes and small words were blurry.
19094,Lol I know. At least they got rid of the puff of air in your eye. I really hated that. Docs suck. I donno y women r so determined to marry them.
19095,Lol oh yeah. Screw men Ill make my own money without poking ppl in the eye
19096,So how's work?
19097,Oooh buy me a drink
19098,Send it on over!
19099,Really? Cause I want the moon...
19100,It's cheaper to do a plan with me. Unlimited everything is required if u want a good phone. By yourself on Verizon with your discount is $ <#> /month. Adding to mine would be an extra $ <#> . That is for the plan. Phones are cheaper at best buy. HTC evo shift is $ <#> there. At sprint.com its $ <#> . It's a good deal.
19101,When is your next break?
19102,The weekend is almost here tho =D
19103,Eek. It's been warm here for weeks now. I don't think its gonna get cold here again.
19104,My moms bday on Sat. I got her a book with a pic of an old lady on it saying where did I leave my glasses...lol then I'll give her the real gift.
19105,I know. Like when she was taking FOREVER to bring my pain meds. I found out why too. She thought I legally changed my name to Cortez. So they couldn't find it.
19106,No! I never wanted to. But everyone kept hounding me about it. Even my dad asked Mark if he was really gonna 'let' me keep my last name. So I just changed it on FB to shut everyone up :/
19107,Lol well they left me alone after that
19108,nobody I know uses a house phone. It's all cell phones.
19109,Cause I keep forgetting to buy lotto tickets
19110,Joanna got scammed. I warned her about it a week ago but she blew me off. Tsk tsk tsk
19111,They found a way to change the item they put in trade to look like an <#> costume. Your really getting a bikini bottom or something cheap. But on your end it will show up as the right costume. Ppl have been making threads about it on the forums for weeks now. Ninjas just close them and say they are false rumors.
19112,But it happened to Joanna today. She traded <#> k for pb bunny that ended up being pants. I warned her tho. She said she was gonna buy an <#> to resell later for profit. I told her all about it and to not to buy anything big for a while. She just said nah they will fix it by the time she saves up.
19113,Lol but I miss u :(
19114,Yes but u need to marry me first. I'm not quitting til I get married!
19115,Yes. You're taking to long
19116,That's your fault!

34794,"Hi Ricky, thanks for your SMS reply. Sorry I've been unable to replyearlier. Our budget is about <#> k, and we'd like to do up the frontof the house (outside gate) too.

34828,Ok thanks. We're almost done with laminate selection and need tohear your opinions on them. See you tomorrow at the new house. PSany problem with the cream colored bathtub on the 2nd floor MBR?
34829,"No problem. We may be inside, so just call me if no one answers thedoor. See you tomorrow!"
34830,"Yes, we're here. Call me when you arrive."
34831,"Ok, thanks will do. Cheaper than buying new one?"
34832,"Hi Ricky, thanks for the info. No estimate on the cost of doing thebathtub in white? Sorry for the extra chaser."
34833,"Hi Ricky, can we meet you tomorrow at <TIME> at your IMM branch? Thanks."
34834,"BTW, have yet to hear from your electrician or air con people. Alsowe'd like to check with you about the attic space, whether it needsBCA approval and the estimated cost. Thanks :-)"
34835,"Sure, no problem. :-) happy to help. We are slated to more outright before the rental period expires, but would definitelyappreciate if Desmond can give us some leeway for moving out at apro-rated rate, if we need to extend due to renovation delays. Itwould certainly make our move to the new place less stressful.Thanks!"
34836,"Hi Ricky, any news from the air con guys? BTW, we are going to haveour own electrician staff come down after all. They will be coming tothe house on Sat, time TBA. Thanks!"
34837,"Hi Sue, thanks for your help. Yes I will let you know closer to theactual date of our move. We appreciate it!"
34838,"Done with meeting, can pick you up from home or other place any time."

34840,"Hi Jiayu, my email is <EMAIL> . thanks!"
34841,"Hi Ricky, I did receive your guys electrical quote,but it did notitemize by area, so its impossible to decide what to take and what toforgo. I thought I forwarded it to you?"
34842,"The aircon quote seems to use the old, original drawings. Is theestimate based on the new third floor? The quote specifies that the2nd floor should take less BTUs than the 3rs which is wrong. We arealso thinking of only doing the guest room on the 1st floor, no hall.Can you double check?"
34843,"Finally, for the attic, can your guy design it as a trapdoor in theceiling? Then no other walls or doors on the attic level necessary.Thanks for your help!"
34844,"Hi Sis, happy weekend ahead. Just wondering, do you know theconfirmed time when your guys are planning to go to the house? Needto confirm with the designer whether ok. Thanks!"
34845,"Ok, will do. Am trying to confirm the timing for tomorrow and willtry to get the drawings to you for your consideration. In youradditional quote, why is the mirrors on the wardrobe chargeable? Ithought the wardrobe price was inclusive of any finishing. Is thatnot the case?"
34846,"Hi jiayu, I've received the softcopy of the invoice. Thank you!"
34847,Thanks. See you then.
34848,Will do. Thanks. If we want other sink or wc than provided thenwhat's the method we should follow?
34849,"Ok, I see. Will discuss next time."
34850,"Hi Ricky, for the aircon, can you get the quotation to specificallystate that Theme are doing all new copper piping with what thicknessand type of insulation? That is important to have on the quote. Ifall then ok, we may sign with Gavin. Will still be checking with theother company."
34851,"As for your feature wall design, we think your design is not quitethere and looks unfinished. I will repropose design and send to youfor your feedback. In particular, the partition and feature wall don'tlook connected or contiguous. Also, thought that you were going toconnect it to the cove light?"
34852,"Finally, since the maid's bathroom is demolished, we need to enlargethe wet kitchen. Will send you the new layout shortly."
34853,Will do. Thanks
34854,"Hi Sis, I've sent you the new wet kitchen layout according to ourdiscussion yesterday night to your yahoo account. Thanks for you andyour company's help again!"
34855,"Sure, can pass u keys tonight. Is that ok? Thanks! :-) :-)"
34856,"Hi Sis, the padlock is <#> . Front door currently not locked."
34857,Ok. Will do. Thanks :-)
34858,"Hi Ricky, we'll meet you tomorrow at IMM at around <#> : <#> as usual?"
34859,"I also tested a transfer to my premier account, but the test transferdidn't show up. Any idea why?"
34860,"Hi Diane, thanks for your answer. If I go to the HSBC branch, do youknow how long it takes to have a cheque's funds clear?"
34861,"Hi, you messaged me twice, but I'm not sure who you are. Can youcheck whether you sent to the correct person? Thanks."
34862,No probblem. Meet at <TIME> pm tomorrow as you requested at my office.
34863,"Hi Ricky, can you get your people to take down the air con blower inthe 2nd floor old MBR? The electrical folks need it removed ASAP?Thanks!"
34864,"Hi Ricky, never mind about the last SMS, the electrical folks figureda way around it. Thanks, and sorry for the hassle."
34865,"Hi Sis, sorry but I don't know what a cct is. We don't have anyschematics or wiring diagrams of the house. The floorplan that youhave is the only blueprint that we know of. I will go back and doublecheck and let you know."
34866,Ok. That's perfect. No rush.
34867,Ok. How late? <TIME> ? We are already on site. Thanks!
34868,"Hi Ricky, the shop's number is <#> <#> . They will be deliveringthe four water heaters tomorrow afternoon. Three are <#> liters,and one is <#> liters. Please help install the <#> for the masterbath on the third floor. Thanks. Li Fen is the name of the lady atthe store, Hupfarri Bath. Thanks."
34869,Can you also let us know the cost for the attic door and whether thepartition can be built? Can you also send us the current floorplans?I still only have thee original ones.

47338,"I think I lost my wallet =/ =/ the worst thing is, it's achecking habit that I've been forcing myself to quash and if I hadn'tI'd have it =/"
47339,Fuck I literally don't know what to do. If I don't find it I willhave no more than five bucks for a month because there's no accessiblewf
47340,Did Mark switch classes?
47341,Is he going?

47360,Yeah haha.. Btw I'm crazy drowsy.. we can call if you want and if Istop responding wake my up
47361,XP
47362,"Alright, you?"
47363,Justin?
47364,That's not so strange lol. Just because you're unnecessarily hostiletowards any notion of religion.. =P
47365,"Iiii dunno. User your best judgement, we've been together for the years =P"
47366,Tshirt stage?
47367,People are religious. They have beliefs. And not just because theywere forced to -.-
47368,That's as bad as psycho religious people lol
47369,Ohhhh
47370,You're the atheist equivalent of the Christian who screams thatyou'll go to if you read Harry Potter
47371,I'm sure they think they're not like that too lol
47372,"Sorry, I just don't understand why you hate it so much"
47373,"Okay, look down on it so much"
47374,"In general I guess so, but if I knew one not like that - and I knowtons of great English majors - I'd see exceptions. You know Justinisn't just"
47375,I wouldn't if she'd proven herself to be a cool person.. instead shesaid she was going to knock on each door to find me the first nighthere
47376,"Yeah, admittedly that was weird... but that could be just as muchpart of him being 'conservative'. Religious people aren't known forbeing against immigrant rights as far as I've seen lol"
47377,Soo
47378,"I guess... I just can't see it as a negative thing myself and don'tnecessarily find it even that illogical... if anything, it's a topicyou could literally never have an actual answer for"
47379,Because religion isn't just that
47380,Plenty of religious people don't believe in creation mythsor impossible floods by or whatever... they just believe an entityexists
47381,"No it's not. Religious people denying certain scientific facts likeevolution or the big or something are dumb and illogical and Ican't respect that either, but religion in conjunction with sense isfine... People like Justin likely don't think they're literallyreading Christ's flesh, and I'm not arguing for every religious personout there... lots ARE batshit insane, like my grandma ""healing mewith the power of Jesus"", trust me I'm not defending that"
47382,"The thing is, people believe in organised religion without buyinginto every aspect of it... plus, lots of churches and things are verychill"
47383,"I've gone to a lot of churches before for a lot of religions. Someare nuts, others are just people who believe in an entity andalso known facts"
47384,"At Unitarian churches you get lots of people from different religionswho just want a good community and chance to believe what they want,not really all that dumb I don't think... they're normal people whoagree with intellectual truths and happen to think ""oh somethinggodlike is out there"""
47385,I don't think you do
47386,I just don't understand why it's incompatible with reasonable thoughtif you take science over religion while still holding religiousbeliefs
47387,"Saying Earth is 6k years old or that woman came from a rib orwhatever is ridiculous... the actual entity isn't in my opinion. Ifscience could prove within reason that a kind if didn't exist,it'd be ridiculous to believe in"
47388,"I see a problem with believing in things counter to evidence we have,but not things without evidence"
47389,"Saying creationism is real is nuts, because we can reasonably price that it is"
47390,Prove
47391,"Because it doesn't serve any purpose I guess... I don't know,religion is half to understand what you can't, primarily death. Thereis no other purpose for the unicorns and any other explanation oftotally unknown stuff could be just as wrong"
47392,"Oh I know, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm sitting herethinking you're just a terrible person who hates him or that I'm onsome elevated plane of whatever lol... I just can tell you what weirdthings you do and get an explanation, whereas, say, Hemisha wouldscoff and berate you if you tried to have a similar conversation lol"
47393,And I conceded to whatever you say about Noah's Ark kind of people =P
47394,Wtf really?
47395,Getting the real frat experience I see
47396,Nice!!!
47397,Hahahah I thought you meant the people outside

47403,"Btw, SLUgS eventually? When should we plan to plan?"
47404,Uggghhhh
47405,Please don't use your frustration with Savannah as a reason to get mad at me
47406,I was sitting there saying that I had some idea of might might workand you kept offering advice I didn't ask for.. I've dealt with thisall day and didn't want to talk about it anymore.. you're the I've whoasked if I found it
47407,Sorry but I've been running around all day and am sick of dealingwith wallet and your advice wasn't going to change anything
47408,Then don't talk to me about things you just want sympathy on. Ever.
47409,I wasn't even talking about it to talk about it. I said I ess tiredfrom running around and you started asking about it
